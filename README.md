## Tech Stack: 

1. Front-end: React (TypeScript)
2. Back-end: Next.js
3. Database: MySQL 

Utilized various libraries, most notably the react-datepicker for the calendar.


### Structure:

Pages:
1. index.tsx - Landing page allowing toggle between 'Coach' and 'Student'
2. coachPage.tsx - Page that a coach would be able to view, add timings, create Reviews. 
3. studentPage.tsx - Page that a student would be able to view their bookings and coach data.
4. /api - All SQL calls lie here. c
5. components -  A couple larger components, the calendar and reviews options. Also one component, 'rRle' was repeated. 
 
### Note:

Hi Stepful Team, 

I enjoyed doing the 'Coaching Conundrum' take home assignment. I was able to complete most of the user stories
and tried to keep all of the data organized. I tried staying close to the 3 hour reccommendation and if I had more time
would have definitley added more product features to make a better fully fledged site. 

I would love to discuss my tech choices, implementation, and improvements for this project. Looking forward to speaking with you!
